I mostly program as a hobby rather than a profession, so you won't see me as involved in these things. While taking this up as a hobby, I plan to learn Swift and C++ in the near future. Main language: **JavaScript**

 - 🧑‍💻 Hobbyist programmer
 - 📷 Hobbyist photographer
 - 🏟️ "Community manager" for some
 - 💥 Currently developing some weird stuff
